Generate Fibonacci Series 
Design the algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart to generate the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence. 

Algorithm 
1.	Start. 
2.	Prompt the user to enter the number of terms n to generate in the Fibonacci series. 

3.	If n is less than or equal to 0, display an error message and stop. 

4.	Initialize two variables: o a = 0 (first term). 

o	b = 1 (second term). 
5.	If n >= 1, display a. 
6.	If n >= 2, display b. 
7.	Use a loop to calculate and display the next terms of the Fibonacci sequence until n terms are generated: o Compute next = a + b. o Update a = b and b = next. 

o	Display next. 
8.	End. 
Pseudocode 
START 
  PROMPT "Enter the number of terms (n): " 
  READ n 
  IF n <= 0 THEN 
    PRINT "Invalid input. Enter a positive integer." 

    EXIT 
  ENDIF 
  SET a = 0 
  SET b = 1 
  IF n >= 1 THEN 
    PRINT a 
  ENDIF 
  IF n >= 2 THEN 
    PRINT b 
  ENDIF 
  FOR i FROM 3 TO n DO 
    SET next = a + b 
    PRINT next 
    SET a = b 
    SET b = next 
  ENDFOR 
 END
