Prime Number Check 
Write the algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart to check whether a given number is a prime number or not. 

Algorithm 
1.	Start. 
2.	Prompt the user to enter a positive integer n. 

3.	If n is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number. 

4.	For numbers greater than 1: 
o	Initialize a loop to check divisors from 2 to n\sqrt{n}n

. 
o	If n is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number. 

5.	If no divisors are found, n is a prime number. 

6.	Display the result. 
7.	End. 
 Pseudocode 
START 
  PROMPT "Enter a positive integer: " 
  READ n 
  IF n <= 1 THEN 
    PRINT n, "is not a prime number." 
    EXIT 
  ENDIF 
  SET isPrime = TRUE 
  FOR i FROM 2 TO âˆšn DO 
    IF n MOD i = 0 THEN 
      SET isPrime = FALSE 
      BREAK 
    ENDIF 
  ENDFOR 
  IF isPrime THEN 
    PRINT n, "is a prime number." 
  ELSE 
    PRINT n, "is not a prime number." 
  ENDIF 
END
