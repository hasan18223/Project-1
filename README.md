Write an algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart for calculating the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n, where n is entered by the user. 

Algorithm 

1.	Start. 
2.	Prompt the user to enter a positive integer n. 
3.	Initialize a variable sum to 0. 
4.	Loop through all numbers from 1 to n. 
o If the number is even (i.e., divisible by 2), add it to sum. 
5.	After the loop ends, print the value of sum. 
6.	End. 

Pseudocode 

START 
  PROMPT "Enter a positive integer (n): " 
  READ n 
  SET sum = 0 
  FOR i FROM 1 TO n DO     IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN       sum = sum + i 
    ENDIF 
  ENDFOR 
  PRINT "The sum of all even numbers from 1 to", n, "is:", sum 
END
