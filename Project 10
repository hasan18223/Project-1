Find the GCD of Two Numbers 
Create an algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. 

Algorithm 
1.	Input: Two positive integers, a and b. 
2.	Step 1: Divide a by b and find the remainder r, i.e., r = a % b. 

3.	Step 2: If r == 0, then the GCD is b. Stop. 

4.	Step 3: Otherwise, set a = b and b = r, and go back to Step 1. 

5.	Output: The value of b when r == 0 is the GCD. 

Pseudocode: 
Function GCD(a, b):     While b != 0:         r = a % b 

a	= b 
b	= r     End While 
    Return a 
End Function
