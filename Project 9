9.	Count Vowels in a String 
Write the algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart to count the number of vowels in a given string input by the user. 

Algorithm 
1.	Start. 
2.	Prompt the user to enter a string. 
3.	Initialize a counter variable vowelCount = 0.

4.	Loop through each character in the string: 

o Convert the character to lowercase. o If the character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 

'o', 'u'), increment vowelCount by 1. 
5.	Display the total number of vowels (vowelCount). 

6.	End. 
Pseudocode 
START 
  PROMPT "Enter a string: " 
  READ inputString 
  SET vowelCount = 0 
  SET vowels = "aeiou" 
FOR EACH character IN inputString DO 
    SET character = LOWERCASE(character) 
    IF character IN vowels THEN 
      SET vowelCount = vowelCount + 1 
    ENDIF 
  ENDFOR 
  PRINT "The number of vowels in the string 
is:", vowelCount END
