Finding the Largest Number in an Array 
Create an algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart for finding the largest number in an array of n elements provided by the user. 

Algorithm 
1.	Start. 
2.	Prompt the user to enter the size of the array n. 

3.	Prompt the user to enter n elements of the array. 

4.	Initialize a variable largest with the value of the first element of the array. 

5.	Iterate through the array starting from the second element: 

o If the current element is greater than largest, update largest to the current element. 

6.	After the loop, largest contains the largest value in the array. 

7.	Display the largest number. 
8.	End. 
Pseudocode 
START 
  PROMPT "Enter the number of elements in the array (n): " 

  READ n 
  DECLARE array[n] 
  PROMPT "Enter the elements of the array: " 
  FOR i FROM 1 TO n DO 
    READ array[i] 
  ENDFOR 
  SET largest = array[1] 
  FOR i FROM 2 TO n DO 
    IF array[i] > largest THEN 
      SET largest = array[i] 
    ENDIF 
  ENDFOR  
  PRINT "The largest number in the array is:", largest 

END
