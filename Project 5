Simple Interest Calculation 
Write an algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart to calculate simple interest based on the formula SI = (P × R × T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. 

Algorithm 
1.	Start. 
2.	Prompt the user to enter the principal amount P. 

3.	Prompt the user to enter the rate of interest R. 

4.	Prompt the user to enter the time in years T. 

5.	Calculate the simple interest using the formula: 

SI=P×R×T100\text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times 
T}{100}SI=100P×R×T 
6.	Display the calculated simple interest SI. 
7.	End. 
Pseudocode 
START 
  PROMPT "Enter the principal amount (P): " 
  READ P 
  PROMPT "Enter the rate of interest (R): " 
  READ R 
  PROMPT "Enter the time in years (T): " 
  READ T 
  SET SI = (P * R * T) / 100 
  PRINT "The Simple Interest (SI) is:", SI 
END
