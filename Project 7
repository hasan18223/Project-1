Number Guessing Game
Write an algorithm, pseudocode, and flowchart for a number guessing game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number with hints provided (e.g., higher/lower). 

Algorithm 
1.	Start. 
2.	Generate a random number target between 1 and 100. 

3.	Initialize a flag variable guessed = False. 

4.	Repeat until guessed is True: o Prompt the user to enter a guess. o If the guess is equal to the target: 

▪	Display "Congratulations! You guessed the number." 

▪	Set guessed = True. o If the guess is less than the target: 

▪	Display "Too low, try again." o If the guess is greater than the target: 

▪	Display "Too high, try again." 
5.	End. 
Pseudocode 
START 
  SET target = RANDOM(1, 100) 
  SET guessed = FALSE 
  WHILE guessed = FALSE DO 
    PROMPT "Enter your guess (1-100): " 
    READ guess 
    IF guess = target THEN 
      PRINT "Congratulations! You guessed 
the number." 
      SET guessed = TRUE 
    ELSE IF guess < target THEN 
      PRINT "Too low, try again." 
    ELSE 
      PRINT "Too high, try again." 
    ENDIF 
  ENDWHILE 
END
